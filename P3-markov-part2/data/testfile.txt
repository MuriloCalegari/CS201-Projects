This is a test. It's only a test, but why won't it work? Because! Simply because it's stupid.
What's up with this? It's a silly thing, a really silly thing. The reason that
finding sentences works is because of punctuation. Any punctuation will do, but
periods, question-marks, and exclamation points do a bang up job!! Get it?
